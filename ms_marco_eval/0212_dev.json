{"query_id": 13582, "answers": ["The quantum superposition principle is not as easy to visualize as the superposition principle in classical physics , since quantum theory makes use of the superposition of alternative states that are mutually exclusive from the classical standpoint . The superposition principle is important both because it simplifies finding solutions to complicated linear problems ( they can be decomposed into sums of solutions of simpler problems ) and because many of the fundamental laws of physics are linear . Because physical systems are generally only approximately linear , the superposition principle is only an approximation of the true physical behaviour . The superposition principle applies to any linear system , including algebraic equations , linear differential equations , and systems of equations of those forms . The stimuli and responses could be numbers , functions , vectors , vector fields , time - varying signals , or any other object which satisfies certain axioms . This principle has many applications in physics and engineering because many physical systems can be modeled as linear systems . For example , a beam can be modeled as a linear system where the input stimulus is the load on the beam and the output response is the deflection of the beam . An example of a physically observable manifestation of superposition is interference peaks from an electron wave in a double - slit experiment . Another example is a quantum logical qubit state , as used in quantum information processing , which is a linear superposition of the basis states and ."]}
